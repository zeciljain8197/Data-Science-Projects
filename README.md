# Data-Science-Projects
Hi, this is Zecil Jain.		
An aspiring data scientist in the making.
Currently working towards upskilling myself in python, machine learning, data analytics and visualization and data science.
This repository was created to store all the projects that I have worked on during my learning path.

P.S: It's a work in progress and hope this journey never ends!!
